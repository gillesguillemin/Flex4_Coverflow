## FLEX 4: COVERFLOW LAYOUT

The other day I already showed you how cool Flex 4′s new layout system is with [my TimeMachine Layout](http://www.flexstuff.co.uk/2009/11/06/flex-4-animated-timemachine-layout/). Pretty much at the same time I knocked together another example, the good ol’ CoverFlow but with my new gig in Paris for Keytree/SAP/Publicis I didn’t get the chance to publish it until now.

Same disclaimer as for the TimeMachine layout: it’s not optimized, some things can certainly be done a different/better way, but at least it works reasonably well and gives another idea of how easy it is to implement complex layouts with Flex 4.
